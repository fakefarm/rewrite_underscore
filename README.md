# Underschool

This repo is translating Underscore QUnit tests into Jasmine specs then, implementing them accordingly. This is an educational exercise to help me level up my understanding of JavaScript, Jasmine, and becoming familiar with all of Underscore's functions.


## Setup

### Pull down Jasmine

Jasmine can be setup as stand alone.
The following instructions are from [Jasmine's homepage](https://jasmine.github.io/pages/getting_started.html)

  JASMINE FOR RUBY

  Add the Jasmine gem to your gemfile:

  `gem 'jasmine'`

  Initialize Jasmine in your project

  Without Rails:

  `jasmine init`

  Run your tests

  Start a server:

  `rake jasmine`

  Run tests in browser:

  `rake jasmine:ci`
