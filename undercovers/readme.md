# Undercovers

This is another way to understand what's going on and how underscore works.

I removed underscore's public api to narrow in on the code that supports the library. At first pass, it seems there are 48 components.

I'm going through each segment at a time to make sure it means. Since these segments are not underscore related my learnings are more open ended to javascript as a while. For now I'm taking notes in individual files that I can run as needed in isolation.
